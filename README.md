<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
Skystead Ranch has players transform a desolate sky island into a vibrant sanctuary. Using your enchanted crook, you can cultivate your garden, befriend quirky creatures, build a home, and uncover secrets along the way. Every decision you make adds a personal touch to your very own unique ranch!

I worked on this project both during my internship and leading up to release. I prototyped features such as the fishing mechanic, controller support, the item selection wheel, and other concepts that didnâ€™t make the final cut.
